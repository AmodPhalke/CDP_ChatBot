# CDP_How-to_ChatBot ðŸš©

Chatbot is an **application of Artificial Intelligence, that interacts with the user, and answers the frequently asked questions**, frees the human resources to prioritize and focus on more critical tasks.

**This Chatbot answers "how-to" questions asked which are related to Customer Data Platforms.**

There are total of 4 Customer Data Platforms (CDP):
      
      1. Segment
      2. mParticle
      3. Lytics
      4. Zeotap

The job of Chatbot is to extract relevant information appropriately from each of the CDP's documentation, and guide the users to perform a task or achieve the desired output.

Project Roadmap:

      1. Extraction of relevant information from each of CDP's documentation.
            Extraction of data is possible by making use of libraries like BeautifulSoup, PyPDF2, pdfplumber.
            Summarization of retreived data can be performed by making use of Transformers.
      2. Conversion of extracted data into embeddings for easy and efficient querying.
      3. Understanding the input query using Intents and Pre-trained models.
      4. Retreival of relevant content.
      5. Handling Irrelevant requests and Cross-Document queryies.
